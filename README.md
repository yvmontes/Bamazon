# Bamazon

This is a MySQL Database called bamazon.

It is a store with different products that were made using a table inside the database.
The table displays: the product ID, name of the product, the department it's in, the price of the item, and the stock quantity.
This store has 10 different products. 

When the application opens, it prompts two questions:

1. what is the ID of the product they would like to buy
2. how many units of the product they would like to buy

<br>
Once the customer has placed the order, the application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
<BR><BR>
If not, the app tells the user there is an insufficient quantity, and prevents the order from going through.<BR>
However, if the store does have enough of the product, it fulfills the customer's order.
